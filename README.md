Testing the Pandas Package with xlrd

# Example "report generator":

* load data from excel
* create pdf 'report' via html template with data table and plot
* send as email (wip)

Instructions:
* Install dependencies (e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt)
* create config.py from config_tesmplate.py!
* run createreport.py
* reads first sheet of testdata file, currently includes (and possibly expects) 3 columns in plot
* outputs z_test_report_[timestamp].pdf

I am, however, responsible if this generates money. 
I'm sure that's how this works :)
