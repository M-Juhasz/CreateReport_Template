# PandasTraining
Testing the Pandas Package with xlrd

# Example "report generator":

* reads first sheet of testdata file, currently includes (and possibly expects) 3 columns in plot
* uses report.html as template for pdf
* outputs z_test_report_[timestamp].pdf
* sends mail with attachment (mail details in config.py!)

Instructions:
* Install dependencies (e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt)
* create config.py from config_template.py!
* run createreport.py

I am, however, responsible if this generates money. 
I'm sure that's how this works :)
